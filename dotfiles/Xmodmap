! this just makes sure that the capslock key is disabled and turn it into a
! third control key.
clear Lock
keycode 66 = Control_L
add Control = Control_L

! this maps everything that can be remapped on a UK keyboard into their
! equivalent US positions.
keycode 11 = 2 at
keycode 12 = 3 numbersign
keycode 48 = apostrophe quotedbl
keycode 49 = grave asciitilde

! the return key is too tall but also too skinny on its bottom half. and there
! is a new key there that is taken up by "#~". For now lets replace that with
! the "\|" key that is usurped by the top of the return key.
keycode 51 = backslash bar

! one final problem is that the left-shift is too short and the right half of
! that is replaced by "\|". For now I'll leave that alone.
